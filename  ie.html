        <p>The first Internet Explorer was derived from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40825033">Spyglass Mosaic</a>. The original Mosaic came from NSCA, but since NCSA was a public entity it relied on Spyglass as its commercialization
            licensing partner. Spyglass it turn delivered two versions of the Mosaic browser to Microsoft, one wholly obased on the NCSA source code, and another engineered from scratch but 
            conceptually modeled on the NCSA browser. Internet Explorer was initially built using the Spyglass, not the NCSA source code. The license to Microsoft provided Spyglass(and thus NCSA) 
            with a quarterly fee plus a percentage of Microsoft's revenues for the software.

            In March 2009 Version 8.0 was released, with the first public beta having been released on March 5, 2008. IE8 offered better support for web standards than previous versions, with plans
            for improved support for RSS, CSS and Ajax, as well as compliance for Cascading Style Sheets 2.1. It was also the first version to successfully pass the Acid2 test. In addition, IE8 included
            new features such as WebSlices and an improved phishing filter.
