        <p>The project which became Firefox started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called m/b(or mozilla/browser). After it had been sufficiently developed, bianries for public testing appeared
            in September 2002 under the name Phoenix.
            <br><br>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_version_history">Firefox 23</a> was release on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking by default to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation  of the range from control 
            attribute in HTML5, dropping support for the blink HTML element as well as text-decoration:blink CSS element, the restriction to have to "switch to a different search provider across the entire browser"
            and a global browser console, a new network monitor  among other things.
